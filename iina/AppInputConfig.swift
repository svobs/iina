   This attempts to mimick the logic in mpv's `get_cmd_from_keys()` function in input/input.c.
   Rebuilds `appBindingsList` and `currentResolverDict`, updating menu item key equivalents along the way.
   When done, notifies the Preferences > Key Bindings table of the update so it can refresh itself, as well
   as notifies the other callbacks supplied here as needed.

   Should be run on the main thread. For other threads, see `rebuildCurrentAsync()`.

   Generally speaking, if the return value of this method is not used, then `thenNotifyPrefsUI` shold be set to true.
   It should only be false if called synchronously by the Key Bindings UI.
