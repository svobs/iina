 A single PlayerInputController instance should be associated with a single PlayerCore, and while the player window has focus, its
 PlayerWindowController is expected to direct key presses to this class's `resolveKeyEvent` method.
 to match the user's key stroke(s) into recognized commands..

 This class also keeps track of any binidngs set by Lua scripts. It expects to be notified of new mpv "input sections" and updates to their
 states, via `defineSection()`, `enableSection()`, and `disableSection()`. These are incorporated into key binding resolution via resolveKeyEvent(.

 The data structures in this class should look similar to mpv's `struct input_ctx`, because they are based on it and attempt to mirror
 its functionality.

 A `KeyMapping` is an association from user input to an IINA or mpv command.
 This can include mouse events (though not handled by this class), single keystroke (which may include modifiers), or a sequence of keystrokes.
 See [the mpv manual](https://mpv.io/manual/master/#key-names) for information on mpv's valid "key names".

 ** Input sections **

 Internally, mpv organizes key bindings into blocks called "input sections", or just "sections", which are identified by name. Because IINA
 doesn't currently support profiles, most IINA users (unless they are using Lua scripts) will only ever care about the implicit "default" section
 whose contents are dictated via input.conf.

 Confusingly, the input file can contain a label, "default-bindings start", which will put the bindings under it into a lower-priority group
 which is referred to by different names at different places in the code: it is either "builtin", "weak", or implied by a "default" flag (or missing
 the "force" flag) when defined. While the user-facing elements (mpv manual, config options) refers to these as "default bindings", it's not
 particularly wise to think of them as defaults, because they can be added and removed just as easily as other bindings; they simply have lower
 priority than their "force" counterparts. And in fact that is encouraged by mpv for authors who are writing Lua scripts.

 Inside this class we'll refer to "strong" (or non-defaults) bindings as having force==true, and "weak" bindings as having force==false.
 While mpv technically allows a mix of force and non-force bindings inside each section, for Lua scripts it is restricted to one type per section.
 We'll just use that para

 ** Key sequences **

 From the mpv manual:

 > It's also possible to bind a command to a sequence of keys:
 >
 > a-b-c show-text "command run after a, b, c have been pressed"
 > (This is not shown in the general command syntax.)
 >
 > If a or a-b or b are already bound, this will run the first command that matches, and the multi-key command will never be called.
 > Intermediate keys can be remapped to ignore in order to avoid this issue.
 > The maximum number of (non-modifier) keys for combinations is currently 4.

 Although IINA's active key bindings (as set in IINA's Preferences window) take effect immediately and apply to all player windows, each player
 window maintains independent state, and in keeping with this, each player's PlayerInputController maintains a separate buffer of pressed keystrokes
 (going back as many as 4 keystrokes).

     Possible flags:
     * `default`: (also used if parameter omitted)
       Use a key binding defined by this section only if the user hasn't already bound this key to a command.
     * `force`: Always bind a key. (The input section that was made active most recently wins if there are ambiguities.)

     This command can be used to dispatch arbitrary keys to a script or a client API user. If the input section defines script-binding commands,
     it is also possible to get separate events on key up/down, and relatively detailed information about the key state. The special key name
     `unmapped` can be used to match any unmapped key.

   Contents will always contain a list of:
     script-binding <name>
     * Invoke a script-provided key binding. This can be used to remap key bindings provided by external Lua scripts.
     * The argument is the name of the binding.

       It can optionally be prefixed with the name of the script, using / as separator, e.g. script-binding scriptname/bindingname.
       Note that script names only consist of alphanumeric characters and _.

   Example script-binding log line from webm script:
    `ESC script-binding webm/ESC`
   Here, `ESC` is the key, `webm/ESC` is the name, which consists of the script name as prefix, then slash, then the binding name.

     (A section cannot be on the stack more than once.)

     The flags parameter can be a combination (separated by +) of the following flags:
     * `exclusive` (MP_INPUT_EXCLUSIVE):
       All sections enabled before the newly enabled section are disabled. They will be re-enabled as soon as all exclusive sections
       above them are removed. In other words, the new section shadows all previous sections.
     * `allow-hide-cursor` (MP_INPUT_ALLOW_HIDE_CURSOR): Don't force mouse pointer visible, even if inside the mouse area.
     * `allow-vo-dragging` (MP_INPUT_ALLOW_VO_DRAGGING): Let mp_input_test_dragging() return true, even if inside the mouse area.
