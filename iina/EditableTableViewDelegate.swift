   OK, this is how standard cut, copy, paste, & delete work. Don't forget again!

   Each of these 4 actions are built into AppKit and will be called in various places: possibly the Edit menu, key equivalents, or toolbar items.
   No assuptions should be made about calling context - just use the state of the table to see what (if anything) should be copied/etc.

   The Edit menu (et all) look for @objc functions named `cut`, `copy`, `paste`, and `delete` and bear the signatures below.
   It goes down the responder chain looking for them, so ideally they should be defined in the first responder's class.
   This means NSTableView or its subclasses, NOT its delegates! Each action will be called only if it exists and passes validation.

   Enablement:
   The responder chain is checked to to see if `validateUserInterfaceItem()` is enabled.
   Each action is disabled by default, and only enabled if this method is present, and returns `true` in response to the associated action.

   This class adds stubs for all the needed functions to `NSTableViewDelegate`, which will be called by `EditableTableView` when appropriate.
   They do not need to be @objc functions.
